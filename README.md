## Hi there 👋

I work with Node JS, Laravel, Vue JS and React JS. I also build some stuff in my free time to fulfil my needs. I am planning to open source some of my ideas this year. I love to write (in private). I have gignatic notes in my notion. I do enjoy playing Skyrim sometimes.

✨ I'm currently working on a MERN boilerplate.

😍 I'm currently learning [In-Depth Laravel](http://indepthlaravel.com)
