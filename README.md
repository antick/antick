## Hi there 👋

I'm a technology lead who loves building impactful software and experimenting with new ideas.
I work with **JavaScript, Nodejs, Nestjs, and Python**, and lately I've been diving deep into **Go** 🚀.
In my free time, I work on my side projects, write on my blogs, and explore ways to merge tech with creativity.

✨ Currently hacking away on side projects (updates coming soon!)
